### About Me
  <hr>
 
```
I am a Software Engineer interested in building intuitive applications that gives the user an easy experience.

My passion for technology is driven by how complex systems are designed and overall architecture of large scale,
distributed systems. This has enabled me to see the importance of data structures in organizing the data stored 
in particular software to be used efficiently. Programming being a problem solving domain makes me appreciative 
of the ways algorithms can be used to identify the best approach to a problem.
  
I am equipped with an entrepreneurial mindset, through which I can provide a solution to an existing problem 
by developing products that impacts people's lives.
